<p>Keele Pitch Reference Database. </p>
<p>This directory contains two sets of data for testing pitch trackers:</p>
<p><b>Speech: </b>contains a simultaneous recording of speech and laryngograph
output for a phonetically balanced text which was read by 10 speakers, five male
and five female.</p>
<p><b>Psycho: </b>contains a series of sound stimuli that have been used in the
past to explore pitch perception.</p>
<p>For further information on the data check out the file 'keele_pitch_database.htm'
in each of the subdirectories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
All individual files are also contained in pitch.zip to make the dowload easy.

<p>Have fun, </p>
